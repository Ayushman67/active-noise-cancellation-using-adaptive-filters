# active-noise-cancellation-using-adaptive-filters

A Digital Signal Processing final project, ECE course code 2003. A comparative study on all adaptive noise cancellation techniques along with their codes in MATLAB.
Along with this the usage of the Least mean square algorithm as an adaptive line enhancer, notch filter and lastly as a bias/drift removal is also studied.
